# rosalind

These are my solutions to various rosalind.info bioinformatic questions written in python.

Rosalind is a free platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving and offers a wide range of problems ranging in biological and computational complexity. Solutions are checked automatically.

Data for each solution can be downloaded at rosalind.info, and the "file" variable can be changed to the local directory location where the data is downloaded on your computer.

Otherwise, the solution can be ran by manually inputing information from the problems.
